    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <h3>You just served a webpage.</h3>
    <p>This page is pretty bare right now but these are the fundamentals that all websites are built upon.  Later in the course we will teach you some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that you can structure more sophisticated pages with more detailed designs and complex functionality.</p>
    <p>Our full time and part time courses will go much more in depth as to what it takes to build the same kinds of web applications that you know and love.  We will be covering the cutting edge frameworks used by industry leaders to create highly performant and beautiful applications.</p>
